# Requirements for Blockchain Implementation

# This project uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies are required for core functionality

# Standard library modules used:
# - hashlib (for MD5 hashing)
# - time (for timestamps and performance measurement)

# Optional development dependencies (for contributors):
# flake8>=4.0.0          # Code style checking
# pytest>=7.0.0          # Testing framework (if adding unit tests)
# black>=22.0.0          # Code formatting (optional)

# Note: This project is designed to work with Python 3.7+ 
# using only built-in libraries to maximize compatibility
# and educational value.
