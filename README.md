## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses built-in libraries)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-implementation.git
cd blockchain-implementation
```

### Run the Project
```bash
# Interactive live demo
cd SRC
python live_demo.py
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Blockchain Operations

```python
# Navigate to the SRC directory first
cd SRC

from Blockchain import Blockchain
from Block import Block

# Create a new blockchain
bc = Blockchain()

# Add blocks without mining
bc.add_block("Nirmal sends 10 coins to Shivangi")

# Add blocks with mining (difficulty = leading zeros required)
bc.add_block("Shivangi sends 5 coins to Nirmal", difficulty=3)

# Validate the blockchain
print(f"Blockchain valid: {bc.is_valid()}")

# Print the entire chain
bc.print_chain()
```

### Interactive Demo

For live presentations and demonstrations:

```bash
cd SRC
python live_demo.py
```

**Menu Options:**
1. Add block without mining
2. Mine with difficulty 1 (1 leading zero)
3. Mine with difficulty 2 (2 leading zeros)
4. Mine with difficulty 3 (3 leading zeros)
5. Custom difficulty mining
6. Display full blockchain
7. Demonstrate tampering detection
8. Validate blockchain integrity

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Block Structure**
Each block contains:
- **Data**: Transaction or information
- **Previous Hash**: Links to previous block
- **Nonce**: Number used once (for mining)
- **Hash**: Unique identifier calculated from all block data

### 2. **Blockchain Linking**
Blocks are cryptographically linked using hashes, creating an immutable chain.

### 3. **Mining (Proof-of-Work)**
- Miners must find a hash that starts with specific number of zeros
- Requires computational work (trying different nonce values)
- Higher difficulty = more zeros required = more work

### 4. **Tampering Detection**
- Any change to block data invalidates the hash
- Broken chain is immediately detectable
- Demonstrates blockchain's security properties

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Hashing Algorithm
- **MD5**: Used for educational simplicity
- **Note**: Real blockchains use SHA-256 for security

### Mining Process
```python
def mine_block(self, difficulty):
    target = "0" * difficulty  # e.g., "000" for difficulty 3
    
    while not self.hash.startswith(target):
        self.nonce += 1
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()
    
    print(f"Block mined! Hash: {self.hash}")
```

### Validation Logic
```python
def is_valid(self):
    for i in range(1, len(self.chain)):
        current = self.chain[i]
        previous = self.chain[i-1]
        
        # Verify hash integrity
        if current.hash != current.calculate_hash():
            return False
            
        # Verify chain linking
        if current.previous_hash != previous.hash:
            return False
    
    return True
